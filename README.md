Dashing dashboard for zabbix trigger

This will provide the total number of alerts on triggers status 
- flash when there's an alert/triggers (color based on the zabbix trigger color format)
- trigger = Warning, Average, High & Disaster
- unacknowledge triggers 
- triggers within 1 hour( you can adjust the number of hour or min ) 
- if the alerts are already okay you need to acknowledge(on zabbix) the alerts with the "OK" status so it will also clear on the dashboard (the purpose of these is so you can monitor closely all the alerts)
